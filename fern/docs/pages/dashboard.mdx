## Manage GPU instances

From the left sidebar of the Dashboard, select [GPU Instances](https://dashboard.fluidstack.io/dashboard/instances) to display all instances on your account. For each instance, the name, configuration, IP address, username for SSH login, associated SSH keys, SSH port, and instance status is displayed.

<Note>You can also manage instances through our API. See the [Instances API reference](/api-reference/instances).</Note>

### Add (create) a GPU instance

Creating instances is performed through our API. See the [Get Started] tutorial for a walk-through of creating an instance, or view the [`POST /instances`](/api-reference/create) endpoint in our [API reference](/api-reference).

### Start and stop an instance

Starting and stopping existing instances is performed through our API. View the [`PUT /instances/:instance_id/start`](/api-reference/instances/start) endpoint for details on starting an instance, or the [`PUT /instances/:instance_id/stop`](/api-reference/instances/stop) endpoint for details on stopping an instance.
