This script interacts with the FluidStack API to manage instances programmatically. It performs several operations, including SSH key management, instance instance creation (both custom and preconfigured), instance status monitoring, and finally, instance deletion.

## Required Modules
- `requests`: for making HTTP requests to the FluidStack API.
- `base64`: for encoding the API key and token in the Authorization header.
- `random`: for randomly choosing between custom and preconfigured instance options, as well as choosing regions and operating systems.
- `pathlib` and `os`: for reading the SSH public key from the user's home directory.

## API Key and Token
You need to replace `"<your_api_key>"`  with your actual FluidStack API key .

## Getting SSH Keys
The script sends a GET request to the `ssh_keys` endpoint to retrieve all existing SSH keys associated with the account. If no SSH keys exist, it reads the public key from the default location (`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) and sends a POST request to the same endpoint to create a new SSH key.

## Getting Instance Types
The script sends a GET request to the `list_available_configurations` endpoint to get all available instance plans.

## Launching instance Instance
The script randomly decides whether to launch an instance, specifying SSH keys, GPU Type, GPU count, and OS.

## Checking instance Status
The script continuously checks the status of the created instance until its status is "running" or "unhealthy". If the status is "unhealthy", the script prints an error message and stops checking.

## Printing instance Details
Once the instance is running, the script prints the instance IP and cost.

## Deleting instance
Finally, the script sends a DELETE request to the `instance` endpoint to delete the created instance.

<Info>
Please note that exception handling is minimal in this script. In a production environment, you'd likely want more robust error checking and handling.
