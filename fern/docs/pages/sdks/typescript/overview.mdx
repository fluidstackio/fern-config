subtitle: About the FluidStack Software Development Kit for TypeScript applications
---

FluidStack's TypeScript SDK assists in developing applications in TypeScript using the FluidStack API.

It includes the following features:

- TypeScript interfaces for all [request and response types](#request-and-response-types)
- [Exception handling](#exception-handling) as subclasses of FluidStackApiError
- Ability to [abort requests](#abort-requests)
- [Runtime compatibility](#runtime-compatibility)
- Ability to [customize the fetch client](#customize-the-fetch-client)
- Configurable [timeouts](#timeouts)
- Automatic [retries](#retries) with exponential backoff

## Request and response types

The SDK exports all request and response types as TypeScript interfaces. Import them with the following namespace:

```ts Example
import { FluidStackApi } from "fluidstack";

const request: FluidStackApi.CreateInstanceRequest = {
    ...
};
const response = await fluidStackApi.create(request);
```

## Exception handling

When the API returns a non-success status code (4xx or 5xx response), a subclass of `FluidStackApiError` is thrown.

```ts Example
import { FluidStackApiError } from 'fluidstack';

try {
    await fluidStackApi.create(...);
} catch (err) {
    if (err instanceof FluidStackApiError) {
        console.log(err.statusCode);
        console.log(err.message);
        console.log(err.body);
    }
}
```

## Abort requests

Abort requests at any point by passing in an abort signal.

```ts Example
const controller = new AbortController();
const response = await fluidStackApi.create(..., {
    abortSignal: controller.signal
});
controller.abort(); // aborts the request
```

# Runtime compatibility

The SDK defaults to `node-fetch` but will use the global `fetch` client if present.

The SDK works in the following runtimes:

- Node.js 18+
- Vercel
- Cloudflare Workers
- Deno v1.25+
- Bun 1.0+
- React Native

## Customize the fetch client

The SDK provides a way for your to customize the underlying HTTP client or `fetch` function. If you're running in an unsupported environment, this provides a way for you to break the glass and ensure that the SDK works.

```ts Example
import { FluidStackApiClient } from 'fluidstack';

const fluidStackApi = new FluidStackApiClient({
    ...
    fetcher: // provide your implementation here
});
```

## Advanced

### Retries

The SDK is instrumented with automatic retries with exponential backoff. A request will be retried as long as the request is deemed retriable and the number of retry attempts has not grown larger than the configured retry limit (default: `2`).

A request is deemed retriable when any of the following HTTP status codes is returned:

- 408 (Timeout)
- 429 (Too Many Requests)
- 5XX (Internal Server Errors)

Use the `maxRetries` request option to configure this behavior.

```ts Example
const response = await fluidStackApi.create(..., {
    maxRetries: 0 // override maxRetries at the request level
});
```

### Timeouts

The SDK defaults to a 60-second timeout. Use the `timeoutInSeconds` option to configure this behavior.

```ts Example
const response = await fluidStackApi.create(..., {
    timeoutInSeconds: 30 // override timeout to 30s
});
```
