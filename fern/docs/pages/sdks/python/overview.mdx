subtitle: About the FluidStack Software Development Kit for Python applications
---

FluidStack's Python SDK assists in developing applications in Python using the FluidStack API.

It includes the following features:

- Type definitions for all request and response fields
- Synchronous and [asynchronous clients](#async-client) powered by [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/)
- Exception handling as subclasses of ApiError
- Configurable [timeouts](#timeouts)
- Automatic [retries](#retries) with exponential backoff

## Async client

The SDK exports an async client for making non-blocking calls to our API.

```python Example
from FluidStack.client import AsyncFluidStack

client = AsyncFluidStack(
    api_key = "<your_api_key>"
)

async def main() -> None:
    await client.ssh_keys.create(
        name = "my_ssh_key_name",
        public_key = "<public key>",
    )
asyncio.run(main())
```

## Exception handling

All errors thrown by the SDK will be subclasses of ApiError.

```python 
import FluidStack

try:
    client.instance.list()
except fluidstack.core.ApiError as e: # Handle all errors
  print(e.status_code)
  print(e.body)
```

## Advanced

### Timeouts

By default, requests will time out after 60 seconds. Configure the timeout duration with the `timeout_in_seconds` option at the client or request level.

```python Example
from FluidStack.client import FluidStack

client = FluidStack(
    ...,
    # All timeouts are 20 seconds
    timeout=20.0,
)

# Override timeout for a specific method
client.auth.get_callback(..., {
    timeout_in_seconds=20.0
})
```

### Retries

The SDK is instrumented with automatic retries with exponential backoff. A request will be retried as long as the request is deemed retriable and the number of retry attempts has not grown larger than the configured retry limit (default: `2`).

A request is deemed retriable when any of the following HTTP status codes is returned:

- 408 (Timeout)
- 429 (Too Many Requests)
- 5XX (Internal Server Errors)

Use the `max_retries` request option to configure this behavior.

```python Example
client.auth.get_callback(..., {
     max_retries=1
})
```

### Custom HTTP client
You can override the httpx client to customize it for your use-case. Some common use-cases include support for proxies and transports.

```python Example
import httpx

from FluidStack.client import FluidStack

client = FluidStack(...,
    http_client=httpx.Client(
        proxies="http://my.test.proxy.example.com",
        transport=httpx.HTTPTransport(local_address="0.0.0.0"),
    ),
)
```

## Beta status
This SDK is in Preview, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update.

To ensure a reproducible environment (and minimize risk of breaking changes), we recommend pinning a specific package version.
