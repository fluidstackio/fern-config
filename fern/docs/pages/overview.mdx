The Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for the FluidStack API is available at [https://platform.fluidstack.io/](https://platform.fluidstack.io/).

To interact with our API, you will need an api_key. 

{/* To get one, navigate to [https://dashboard.fluidstack.io](https://dashboard.fluidstack.io) and look in the “Instant Deployment API” section. Grab your API key and API token there.

Your API key cannot be changed, but you can regenerate a random API token anytime from your dashboard.
