The Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for the FluidStack API is available at [https://api.fluidstack.io/](https://api.fluidstack.io/).

To interact with our API, you will need an api_key and an api_token. Think of it as your username and password.

To get one, navigate to [https://console.fluidstack.io](https://console.fluidstack.io) and look in the “Instant Deployment API” section. Grab your API key and API token there.

Your API key cannot be changed, but you can regenerate a random API token anytime from your dashboard.
