You can pass your api_key and api_token as url parameters using the following format:

```bash maxLines=0
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --request GET 'https://<api_key>:<api_token>@api.fluidstack.io/v1/servers'
```

You can also pass them using basic access authentication with the following format:

```bash maxLines=0
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --request GET 'https://api.fluidstack.io/v1/servers' -u '<your_api_key>:<your_api_token>'
```
