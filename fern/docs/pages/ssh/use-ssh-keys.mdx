subtitle: Connect to an instance using an SSH key
---

You must provide an [SSH key](/ssh/what-is-ssh#about-ssh-keys) when you create a GPU instance with FluidStack. Once the instance is running, that SSH key is used to authenticate for remote command-line access to the instance.

## Generate a public/private key pair

<Markdown src='../../snippets/public-key-formats.mdx' />

If you already have a public/private key pair of a supported format, you can use that pair instead of generating a new one.

Follow the steps below to generate a key pair with a command-line tool called **ssh-keygen**. This tool is pre-installed on nearly all operating systems.

Use any supported format for your key pair. The tabs below contain instructions for generating a key pair with either the [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) algorithm or [ECDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm) algorithm.

  <Tab title='RSA'>
    <Steps>
      ### Generate the key pair
      Enter the following command in your CLI shell:
```bash
ssh-keygen
```
      If prompted to enter a filename, press `Enter` to save the key pair to the default location (`~/.ssh/`). When prompted to enter a passphrase, you can optionally do so to increase security.

      <br />
      ### Confirm that your key pair was created
      Enter the following command to confirm that your key pair was created:
```bash 
ls ~/.ssh
```
    In the output, you should see `id_rsa` (the file that contains your private key) and `id_rsa.pub` (the file that contains your public key).
    
      <br />
      ### View your public key
      Open the `id_rsa.pub` file in a plaintext editor, or enter the command below to output it to your terminal:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
    </Steps>

  <Tab title='ECDSA with NIST curves'>
    <Steps>
    ### Generate the key pair
    Enter the following command in your CLI shell:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 256 -f ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_256
```
    If prompted to enter a filename, press `Enter` to save the key pair to the default location (`~/.ssh/`). When prompted to enter a passphrase, you can optionally do so to increase security.

    <br />

    ### Confirm that your key pair was created

    Enter the following command to confirm that your key pair was created:
```bash 
ls ~/.ssh
```

    In the output, you should see `id_ecdsa_256` (the file that contains your private key) and `id_ecdsa_256.pub` (the file that contains your public key).
    <br />

    ### View your public key

    Open the `id_ecdsa_256.pub` file in a plaintext editor, or enter the command below to output it to your terminal:

```bash 
cat ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_256.pub
```

<Warning title="Warning">
  With any public/private key pair that you generate, your public key can be shared freely. Your private key should be just thatâ€”private! Take care not to share it with others, or in public repositories such as in GitHub. 
</Warning>

## Create an SSH key

Use your public key to create an SSH key on your FluidStack account. If you don't have a public key, see: [Generate a public/private key pair](#generate-a-publicprivate-key-pair).

<Tip title="Tip">In this context, 'creating an SSH key' means 'storing (adding) a copy of your public key on your FluidStack account.' The stored SSH key is identical to your public key.</Tip>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title='Use the FluidStack API'>
    Create an SSH key by using the [Create an SSH key](/api-reference/ssh-keys/create) endpoint.

    <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint='POST /ssh_keys' />

    <Tip title="Tip">Make sure to replace the `<api-key>` value with your API key, the `<public-key>` value with your public key, and the `name` of `my_ssh_key` with the unique SSH key name you'd like to use.</Tip>

    If your POST request is successful, the endpoint responds with a JSON object that echoes the `name` and `public_key` that you sent:

```json title='Response example'
{
    "name": "my_ssh_key",
    "public_key": "<your_public_key>"
}
```

    View SSH keys that have been added to your FluidStack account by using the [List SSH keys](/api-reference/ssh-keys/list) endpoint:

    <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint='GET /ssh_keys' />

    If your GET request is successful, the endpoint responds with a JSON array of objects. Each object in the JSON array represents an SSH key, including its `name` and `public_key`: 

```json title='Example response'
[
    {
        "name": "my_ssh_key",
        "public_key": "<public_key>"
    },
    {
        "name": "another_ssh_key",
        "public_key": "<public_key>"
    }
]

  <Accordion title='Use the FluidStack API'>

    Delete an SSH key by using the [Delete an SSH key](/api-reference/ssh-keys/delete) endpoint. Replace the text `{ssh_key_name}` with the name of the key you want to delete:

    <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint='DELETE /ssh_keys/:ssh_key_name' />

## Connect to an instance with an SSH key

Use your private key to authenticate when connecting to a running instance via SSH. The instance has an SSH key associated with it, provided when that instance was created. The private key must correspond to that SSH key.
