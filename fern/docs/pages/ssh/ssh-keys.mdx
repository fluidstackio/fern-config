An **SSH key** is required to create a cloud-based GPU instance with FluidStack. Once the instance is running, use the SSH key for remote command-line access to the instance.

## What is an SSH key?

FluidStack allows [Secure Shell (SSH)](/ssh/what-is-ssh) access to instances. For improved security, we use [public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) for authentication instead of a password. This method requires that you provide your own **public/private key pair**. 

Your public key is stored on your instance as your SSH key. Its corresponding private key is stored locally on the computer that you use to access your instance. SSH access is granted by verifying that your private key corresponds to the public key. As an analogy, you can think of a public key as a lock that only your private key can unlock.

<Tip>Public/private key pairs are used for many purposes, not only SSH. For example, they are used in file encryption, digital signatures, and cryptocurrency transactions.</Tip>

## Generate a public/private key pair

<Markdown src="../../snippets/public-key-formats.mdx" />

If you already have a public/private key pair of a supported format, you can use it instead of generating a new pair.

You can generate a public/private key pair for authenticating SSH connections by using a command-line tool called **ssh-keygen**. This tool comes pre-installed on nearly all operating systems.

You can use any supported format for your key pair. The tabs below contain instructions for generating a key pair with either the [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) algorithm or [ECDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm) algorithm.

  <Tab title="RSA">
    <Steps>
      ### Generate the key pair
      Enter the following command in your CLI shell:
```bash
ssh-keygen
```
      If prompted to enter a filename, press `Enter` to save the key pair to the default location (`~/.ssh/`). When prompted to enter a passphrase, you can optionally do so to increase security.

      <br />
      ### Confirm that your key pair was created
      Enter the following command to confirm that your key pair was created:
```bash 
ls ~/.ssh
```
    In the output, you should see `id_rsa` (the file that contains your private key) and `id_rsa.pub` (the file that contains your public key).
    
      <br />
      ### View your public key
      Open the `id_rsa.pub` file in a plaintext editor, or enter the command below to output it to your terminal:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
    </Steps>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="ECDSA with NIST curves">
    <Steps>
    ### Generate the key pair
    Enter the following command in your CLI shell:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 256 -f ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_256
```
    If prompted to enter a filename, press `Enter` to save the key pair to the default location (`~/.ssh/`). When prompted to enter a passphrase, you can optionally do so to increase security.

    <br />

    ### Confirm that your key pair was created

    Enter the following command to confirm that your key pair was created:
```bash 
ls ~/.ssh
```

    In the output, you should see `id_ecdsa_256` (the file that contains your private key) and `id_ecdsa_256.pub` (the file that contains your public key).
    <br />

    ### View your public key

    Open the `id_ecdsa_256.pub` file in a plaintext editor, or enter the command below to output it to your terminal:

```bash 
cat ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_256.pub
```
    </Steps>

<Warning>
  With any public/private key pair that you generate, your public key can be shared freely. Your private key should be just thatâ€”private! Do not share it with others, or in public repositories such as in GitHub. 
</Warning>

## Create an SSH key

Use your public key to create an SSH key on your FluidStack account. In this context, _creating an SSH key_ means _storing (adding) a copy of your public key on your FluidStack account_. The stored SSH key is identical to your public key.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use the FluidStack API">
    Create an SSH key by using the [`POST /ssh_keys`](/api-reference/ssh-keys/create) endpoint. You can call this endpoint programmatically, or by using a command-line tool such as [cURL](https://curl.se/):

    <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /ssh_keys" />

    <Tip>Make sure to replace the `<api-key>` value with your API key, the `<public-key>` value with your public key, and the `name` of `mykey` with the unique SSH key name you'd like to use.</Tip>

    If your POST request is successful, the endpoint responds with a JSON object that echoes the `name` and `public_key` that you sent:

    ```json title="Response example"
    {
        "name": "mykey",
        "public_key": "<your_public_key>"
    }

    View SSH keys on your FluidStack account by using the [`GET /ssh_keys`](/api-reference/ssh-keys/list) endpoint:

    <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /ssh_keys" />

    If your GET request is successful, the endpoint responds with a JSON array of objects. Each object in the JSON array represents an SSH key, including its `name` and `public_key`: 

```json title="Example response"
[
    {
        "name": "mykey",
        "public_key": "<public_key>"
    },
    {
        "name": "myotherkey",
        "public_key": "<public_key>"
