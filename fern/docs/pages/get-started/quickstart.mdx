subtitle: Create, access, and terminate your first GPU instance using the FluidStack API
---

## Overview

This FluidStack API tutorial leads you through the following steps:

1. [Create your first GPU instance](#create-a-gpu-instance).
2. [Check the status of your instance.](#check-the-status-of-your-instance)
2. [Access your instance](#access-your-instance) using an SSH client and your SSH key.
3. [Terminate your instance](#terminate-your-instance).

<Tip>If you'd rather use the FluidStack Dashboard UI to manage instances instead of the API, see: [Dashboard - Instances](/dashboard/instances).</Tip>

## Prerequisites

- An [API key](/dashboard/api-keys)
- An [SSH key](/dashboard/ssh-keys)
- Familiarity with command-line tools

## Steps

<Steps>
### Create a GPU instance

In this step, you will create an instance with the following configuration and operating system template:

| GPU Type         | GPU Count | CPU Count | RAM Size | NVME Storage Size | OS Template
|------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------------|-----------------
| RTX_A6000_48GB   | 1         | 16        | 59GB     | 425 GB            | Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

<Note>
  If you prefer, you can use a different [instance configuration](/instances/configurations) and/or [operating system](/instances/operating-systems).
</Note>

Let's create your first instance! Copy this cURL command:

```bash cURL command
curl -X POST https://platform.fluidstack.io/instances \
    -H "api-key: <api-key>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
  "gpu_type": "RTX_A6000_48GB",
  "name": "my-test-instance",
  "ssh_key": "my_ssh_key"
}'
```

<Warning>The `$` and `>` characters are not intended to be copied.</Warning>

{/* If you have multiple SSH keys you'd like to associate with this instance, provide a comma-separated list in the cURL command:

```bash Multiple SSH keys example {2-4}
    "ssh_keys": [
      "my_key1",
      "my_key2",
      "my_key3"
    ]
``` */}

Paste the command to a location where you can edit its text in plaintext format, such as a code editor. Replace the text `<api_key>` with your API key, and `my_ssh_key` with the name of an SSH key on your account. 

If your request succeeds, the endpoint will respond with the created instance's `id`, `name`, `gpu_type`, and `operating_system_label`:

```json Example of a successful response
{
  "id": "i-1234567890",
  "name": "my_test_instance",
  "gpu_type": "RTX_A6000_48GB",
  "operating_system_label": "ubuntu_20_04_lts"
}
```
Take note of the `id` of your instance for the next step.

<Note>
Did you notice that the cURL command you sent did not specify an `operating_system_label`? 

When the operating system is not specified, a default value is used. The only values you're required to specify when creating an instance are the instance `name`, `gpu_type`, and `ssh_key`.
</Note>

### Check the status of your instance

Request the instance's status using the [List user instances](/api-reference/instances/list) endpoint:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /instances" />

Initially, the instance's `status` will be `pending`. Once the instance is created and available, its `status` will update to `running` and FluidStack will assign it an IP address.

Example:
```json A response that shows a running instance
[
  {
    "id": "i-1234567890",
    "status": "running",
    "username": "ubuntu",
    "ssh_port": "22",
    "ssh_keys": [
      "my_ssh_key"
    ],
    "ip_address": "192.0.2.0",
    "name": "my_test_instance",
    "current_rate": 1,
    "configuration": {
      "id": "c-1234567890",
      "gpu_count": 1,
      "cpu_count": 16,
      "nvme_storage_size_gb": 425,
      "memory_size_gb": 59,
      "gpu_model": {
        "name": "RTX_A6000_48GB",
        "memory_size_gb": 48
      },
      "cpu_model": "generic",
      "estimated_provisioning_time_minutes": 5
    },
    "created_at": "2024-01-15T09:30:00Z"
  }
]

```

This endpoint returns a JSON array of all the instances on your account, with each instance represented as an object in the array. 

Locate the instance object with the `id` of your newly created instance. Take note of that instance's values for `username` and `ip_address` for the next step.

### Access your instance 

Once the instance's status is `running`, you can connect to it using SSH. Use the private key that corresponds to the public key you used when creating the SSH key for this instance, and the `username` and `ip_address` you noted in the previous step. 

<Markdown src="../../snippets/connect-with-ssh.mdx" />

<Note>The first time you connect to your instance, you will see a message that says "The authenticity of host `x.x.x.x` can't be established ... Are you sure you want to continue connecting". This is normal for the first connection. Type `yes` and press `Enter`.</Note>

When you have successfully logged in, notice that your command prompt has changed. All commands that you enter into this command prompt are executed on your instance.

When you're ready to close your connection and log out from the instance, type `exit` into your SSH session's command prompt and press `Enter`. You should be returned to your local machine's command prompt.

### Terminate your instance

To terminate your instance, first close your SSH connection, then call the API using the cURL command below. Replace the text `instance_id` in the endpoint's path with the `id` you received when you created the endpoint, and `<api_key>` with your API key.

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="DELETE /instances/:instance_id" />

Example:

```bash title="Example request"
  curl -X DELETE https://platform.fluidstack.io/instances/i-1234567890 \
  -H "api-key: api_key_j123MyFakeAPIKey"
```

To confirm that your instance was deleted, call the [List user instances](/api-reference/instances/list) endpoint again as in Step 2.

</Steps>

Congratulations! You have successfully created an instance, accessed it using SSH, and deleted the instance.
