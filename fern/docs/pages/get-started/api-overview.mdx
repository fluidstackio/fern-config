The FluidStack API is a RESTful API you can use for command-line and programmatic management of your instances and SSH keys. You can also use it to retrieve information about available configurations and operating system templates.

## Base URL

`https://platform.fluidstack.io/`

## Authentication

An **API key** is required for authentication to use the FluidStack API. Your API key is unique to your FluidStack account. Conceptually, it is similar to a password that is sent with every API call. 

[View, add, and delete your API keys](/dashboard/api-keys) from the FluidStack Dashboard.

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys secure! Treat them like you would any other password. Do not share them with others, or in public repositories such as in GitHub. 
</Warning>

### How to use your API key

Whenever you make a call to the FluidStack API, include your API key in the request headers with a header name of `api-key`. Otherwise, your call will fail. 

Example:
<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /instances" />

### Requests and responses

All request and response bodies are sent in JSON format. When sending data in the body of a request, always include the header `"Content-Type: application/json"`.

## Programmatic API use
