description: An overview of the FluidStack API, including the base URL, authentication, how to use the API key, request and response format, and programmatic use of the API.
---

The FluidStack API is a RESTful API you can use for command-line and programmatic management of your instances and SSH keys. You can also use it to retrieve information about available configurations and operating system templates.

[View the full API reference.](/api-reference)

## Base URL

`https://platform.fluidstack.io/`

## Authentication

An **API key** is required for authentication to use the FluidStack API. Your API key is unique to your FluidStack account. Conceptually, it is similar to a password that is sent with every API call. 

[View, add, and delete your API keys](/dashboard/api-keys) from the FluidStack Dashboard.

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys secure! Treat them like you would any other password. Do not share them with others, or in public repositories such as in GitHub. 
</Warning>

### How to use your API key

Whenever you make a call to the FluidStack API, include your API key in the request headers with a header name of `api-key`. Otherwise, your call will fail. 

Example:
<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /instances" />

### Requests and responses

All request and response bodies are sent in JSON format. When sending data in the body of a request, always include the header `"Content-Type: application/json"`.

## Programmatic API use

### Instance management

See an example of [how to use Python to manage instances](/instances/manage/programmatic).

### Python SDK

Use our [Python SDK](/sdks/python-sdk) to interface with our API in your Python applications.

### Secure use of your API key

For security, avoid placing your API key in any file that could potentially be seen by others.

There are many ways to safeguard the privacy of your API key. One common approach is using an `.env` file. Create a file named `.env` or look for one that already exists in your project. Add your key to it, then use the `dotenv` module to import it into your Python file. 

Example:

```properties .env file
FLUIDSTACK_API_KEY="api_key_j123YourAPIKey"
```
<CodeBlocks>
```python Python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv() # load the variables from your .env file

api_key = os.getenv('FLUIDSTACK_API_KEY') # Use your API key securely
```

```python Python SDK
from FluidStack.client import FluidStack
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv() # load the variables from your .env file

client = FluidStack(
  api_key = os.getenv('FLUIDSTACK_API_KEY') # Use your API key securely
)
```
</CodeBlocks>
<Warning>
  If your `.env` file is inside a git repository, make sure that it's added to the [`.gitignore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file for that repository.
