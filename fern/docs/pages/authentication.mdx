subtitle: API and SSH keys

## API keys

An **API key** is required for authentication to use the [FluidStack API](/api-reference). Your API key is unique to your FluidStack account. Conceptually, it is similar to a password that is sent with every API call. 

[View, add, and delete your API keys](/dashboard#manage-api-keys) from the FluidStack Dashboard.

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys secure! Treat them like you would any other password. Do not share them with others, or in public repositories such as in GitHub. 
</Warning>

### Use your API key

Whenever you make a call to the FluidStack API, include your API key in the request headers. Otherwise, your call will fail. 

Example:
<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /instances" />

## SSH keys

An **SSH key** is required to create and log into an instance. [Learn how to create and manage SSH keys.](/ssh/ssh-keys)

### Use your SSH key

Whenever you create an instance, you must provide one or more SSH keys. If more than one person will need remote access to the instance, provide a different SSH key for each person.

Once the instance is running, use your private key to authenticate when connecting to the instance. The private key must correspond to a public key that you used for one of the SSH keys associated with that instance.
