subtitle: How to authenticate with API and SSH keys
---

## API keys

An **API key** is required for authentication to use the FluidSpring API. The API key is connected to your FluidSpring account. Conceptually, it is similar to a password that is sent with every API call. 

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys secure! Treat them like you would any other password. Do not share them with others, or in public repositories such as in GitHub. 
</Warning>

### Create an API key

Create, view, and delete your API keys from the [FluidStack Dashboard](https://dashboard.fluidstack.io/dashboard/api-keys).

### Use your API key

Whenever you make a call to the FluidStack API, include your API key in the request headers. Otherwise, your call will fail. 

Example:
<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /instances" />

## SSH keys

The SSH (Secure SHell) protocol is used for command-line access to a running instance. It uses public-key cryptography for authentication.

Access requires a public/private key pair. You must [generate a key pair locally](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/keygen), then use its public key to create an SSH key on your FluidStack account. In this context, _creating an SSH key_ means _storing a copy of a public key on your FluidStack account_. The stored SSH key is identical to your public key.

You can create an SSH key from the FluidStack Dashboard, or with the FluidStack API.

### Create an SSH key from the FluidStack Dashboard

1. Open the [SSH Keys page on the FluidStack Dashboard](https://dashboard.fluidstack.io/dashboard/ssh-keys).
2. Select **Add SSH key** from the top right corner.
3. In the popup form's **Name** field, input a unique name for this SSH key. 
4. Paste your public key in the field labeled **Public SSH key**. Click **Confirm**.

### Create an SSH key using the FluidStack API

You can create an SSH key on your FluidStack account by using the [`POST /ssh_keys`](/api-reference/ssh-keys/create) endpoint. You can call this endpoint programmatically, or by using a command-line tool such as [cURL](https://curl.se/):

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /ssh_keys" />

If your POST request is successful, the endpoint responds with a JSON object that echoes the `name` and `public_key` that you sent.

```json title="Response example"
{
    "name": "mykey",
    "public_key": "<your_public_key>"
}
```

### Use your SSH key

Whenever you create a new instance, you must provide one or more SSH keys. Once the instance is running, use the SSH key to authenticate when connecting to the instance via an SSH client.
