subtitle: How to authenticate with API and SSH keys
---

## API keys

An **API key** is required for authentication to use the FluidSpring API. The API key is connected to your FluidSpring account. Conceptually, it is similar to a password that is sent with every API call. 

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys secure! Treat them like you would any other password. Do not share them with others, or in public repositories such as in GitHub. 
</Warning>

### Create an API key

Create, view, and delete your API keys from the [FluidStack Dashboard](https://dashboard.fluidstack.io/dashboard/api-keys).

### Use your API key

Whenever you make a call to the FluidStack API, include your API key in the request headers. Otherwise, your call will fail. 

Example:
<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /instances" />

## SSH keys

An **SSH key** is required to create an instance, and to log into an instance remotely using the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol. 

Instead of a login password, FluidStack requires [public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) for authentication. This means that you must have a public/private key pair for encryption.

### Create an SSH key

If you do not already have a public/private key pair, you must [generate one locally](/get-started#create-a-publicprivate-key-pair), then use its public key to [create an SSH key on your FluidStack account](/get-started#create-a-ssh-key-on-your-fluidstack-account). In this context, _creating an SSH key_ means _storing a copy of a public key on your FluidStack account_. The stored SSH key is identical to the public key.

### Use your SSH key

Whenever you create a new instance, you must provide one or more SSH keys. If more than one person will need remote access to the instance, provide a different SSH key for each person.

Once the instance is running, use your private key to authenticate when connecting to the instance. The private key should correspond to a public key that you used for one of the SSH keys associated with that instance.

```bash title="Connect to your instance with SSH"
ssh -i <path_to_your_private_key> <username>@<ip_address>
```

Example:
```bash 
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ubuntu@192.0.2.0
```
