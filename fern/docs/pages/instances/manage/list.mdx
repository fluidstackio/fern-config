Call the [List user instances](/api-reference/instances/list) endpoint:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /instances" />

<Markdown src="../../../snippets/api-key-header.mdx" />

Example response:

<EndpointResponseSnippet endpoint="GET /instances" />

If your request succeeds, the endpoint will respond with a JSON array containing one or more objects.

Each object contains the details for an instance belonging to the user whose API key was provided in the header. 

For further details, see the [API Reference](/api-reference/instances/list).
