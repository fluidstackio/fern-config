subtitle: How to terminate an instance with the FluidStack API
---

The instance's `id` is required to terminate it. To find the `id` of an instance, see [List instances](/instances/manage/list).

Call the [Terminate an instance](/api-reference/instances/delete) endpoint:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint='DEL /instances/:instance_id' />

<Markdown src='../../../snippets/api-key-header.mdx' /> 

Also, replace the text `{instance_id}` in the endpoint's path with your instance's `id`. 

Example request with cURL:
```bash 
curl -X DELETE https://platform.fluidstack.io/instances/i-1234567890 \
     -H "api-key: api_key_j123MyFakeAPIKey"
```

If your request succeeds, the endpoint will respond with a status code of `204`. No data will be returned in the response body.

For further details, see the [API Reference](/api-reference/instances/delete).
