subtitle: How to stop and start an instance with the FluidStack API
---

You can only stop an instance that has the `status` of `running`, and you can only start an instance that has the `status` of `stopped`.  The instance's `id` is required to stop or start it. To find the `id` and `status` of an instance, see [List instances](/instances/manage/list) or [Fetch a single user instance](/instances/manage/get).

### Stop an instance

Call the [Stop an instance](/api-reference/instances/stop) endpoint:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint='PUT /instances/:instance_id/stop' />

<Markdown src='../../../snippets/api-key-header.mdx' /> 

Also, replace the text `{instance_id}` in the endpoint's path with your instance's `id`. 

Example request with cURL:
```bash 
curl -X PUT https://platform.fluidstack.io/instances/i-1234567890/stop \
     -H "api-key: api_key_j123MyFakeAPIKey"
```

Example response:

<EndpointResponseSnippet endpoint='PUT /instances/:instance_id/stop' />

If your request succeeds, the endpoint will respond with a status code of `200` and JSON object containing your instance's details, including its current `status`.

The instance `status` should show as either `stopping` or `stopped`. In this state, your instance is offline and cannot be used or reached until you restart it. 

For further details, see the [API Reference](/api-reference/instances/stop).

### Start an instance

Call the [Start an instance](/api-reference/instances/start) endpoint:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint='PUT /instances/:instance_id/start' />

<Markdown src='../../../snippets/api-key-header.mdx' /> 

Also, replace the text `{instance_id}` in the endpoint's path with your instance's `id`. 

Example request with cURL:
```bash 
curl -X PUT https://platform.fluidstack.io/instances/i-1234567890/start \
     -H "api-key: api_key_j123MyFakeAPIKey"
```

Example response:

<EndpointResponseSnippet endpoint='PUT /instances/:instance_id/start' />

If your request succeeds, the endpoint will respond with a status code of `200` and an JSON object containing your instance's details, including its current `status`. The instance `status` should show as either `pending` or `running`. 

For further details, see the [API Reference](/api-reference/instances/start).
