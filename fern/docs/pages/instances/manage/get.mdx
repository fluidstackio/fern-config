subtitle: How to view an existing instance with the FluidStack API
---

Call the [Fetch a single user instance](/api-reference/instances/get) endpoint:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint='GET /instances/:instance_id' />

<Markdown src='../../../snippets/api-key-header.mdx' />

Example response:

<EndpointResponseSnippet endpoint='GET /instances/:instance_id' />

If your request succeeds, the endpoint will respond with a JSON containing one object.

Each object contains the details for an instance belonging to the user whose API key was provided in the header. 

For further details, see the [API Reference](/api-reference/instances/get).
