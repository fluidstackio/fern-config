The Python scripts on this page demonstrates how the [FluidStack API](/api-reference) can be used to manage instances programmatically. 

You can choose to use Python only, or you can use our [Python SDK](/sdks/python/overview). 

## Prerequisites
  - An [API key](/dashboard/api-keys)
  - A [public/private key pair](/ssh/use-ssh-keys#generate-a-publicprivate-key-pair)
  - Basic familiarity with Python; Python 3+ installed

## Script overview

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python script">
    <Steps>
      ### Create an SSH key

      The script reads the public key located at `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`, then sends a request to the [Create an SSH key](/api-reference/ssh-keys/create) endpoint to create a SSH key named `python_ssh_key`. This SSH key is a copy of the public key that was read.

      <Warning>
        - If you already have an SSH key named `python_ssh_key`, change the script to use a different, unique name.
        - If your public key is in a different location or filename, make sure to update this part of the script.
      </Warning>

      ### Create an instance

      The script creates an instance by sending a request to the [Create a new instance](/api-reference/instances/create) endpoint.
      
      The API key is sent in the request as a header. A custom name for the instance, the GPU type, and the name of the SSH key to use for accessing the instance are sent in the JSON body of the request.

      ### Check the instance status

      Initially, the instance's `status` is `pending`. The script repeatedly checks this `status` until it is `running` by sending requests to the [List user instances](/api-reference/instances/list) endpoint and parsing the response. 

      This status-checking loop stops once the instance's `status` returns as `running`, or if its `status` indicates that it has been `terminated` or is otherwise unable to run.

      ### Print the instance IP

      Once the instance's status is `running`, the script prints the instance's IP address.

      ### Terminate the instance

      Finally, the script uses the [Terminate an instance](/api-reference/instances/delete) endpoint to delete the instance.

    <Steps>
      ### Instantiate a client
      
      The script uses the FluidStack SDK to instantiate an API client, passing a valid API key. 
      
      The instantiated client is configured with the API key and base URL of the API server, which means you can make requests without manually providing that information every time. 

      ### Create an SSH key

      The script reads the public key located at `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`, then sends a request to the [Create an SSH key](/api-reference/ssh-keys/create) endpoint to create a SSH key named `python_sdk_ssh_key`. This SSH key is a copy of the public key that was read.

      <Warning>
        - If you already have an SSH key named `python_sdk_ssh_key`, change the script to use a different, unique name.
        - If your public key is in a different location or filename, make sure to update this part of the script.
      </Warning>

      ### Create an instance

      The script creates an instance, using the `client.instances.create()` method.

      A custom name for the instance, the GPU type, and the name of the SSH key to use for accessing the instance are provided to the method. The client handles sending the request to the [Create a new instance](/api-reference/instances/create) endpoint, using the API key provided when the client was instantiated.

      ### Check the instance status

      Initially, the instance's `status` is `pending`. The script repeatedly checks this `status` until it is `running` using the `client.instances.list()` method and parsing the response. 

      This status-checking loop stops once the instance's `status` returns as `running`, or if its `status` indicates that it has been `terminated` or is otherwise unable to run.

      ### Print the instance IP

      Once the instance's status is `running`, the script prints the instance's IP address.

      ### Terminate the instance

      Finally, the script terminates the created instance, using the `client.instances.delete()` method.
