A configuration consists of the specific GPU, CPU, and storage settings for an instance.

### Get the list of available configurations

To see available configurations, call the [List available configurations](/api-reference/configurations/list) endpoint.

Example request:
<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint='GET /list_available_configurations' />

Make sure to replace the `<api_key>` with your own [API key](/get-started/api-overview#authentication).

The endpoint returns a list of configuration objects, as shown in this example response:
<EndpointResponseSnippet endpoint='GET /list_available_configurations' />

When you [create an instance](/api-reference/instances/create), you must specify a value for `gpu_type`. The value you specify for `gpu_count` determines the CPU count, as well as the RAM and NVME storage sizes.

<Note title="Note">If you do not provide a value for `gpu_count` when creating an instance, `1` is used as the default.</Note>
