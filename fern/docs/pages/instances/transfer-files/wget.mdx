subtitle: Download files to your instance from a server
---

The `wget` command is used to download files from HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP servers. It is particularly useful for downloading files directly to your instance from a web server.

To upload files or directories to your instance, see our documentation on [scp](/instances/transfer-files/scp) and [rsync](/instances/transfer-files/rsync).

## Basic syntax

Run the `wget`command from an SSH session on your instance to download files:

```bash
wget <URL_of_source_file>
```

### Example

```bash
wget https://www.example.com/index.html
```

This command downloads the file located at `https://www.example.com/index.html` to the current directory on your instance.

## Commonly used options

### Rename the downloaded file

To download the file under a different name, use the `-O` option:

```bash
wget -O <desired_filename> <URL_of_source_file>
```

**Example**

Download `index.html` from `https://www.example.com/` and save it as `myfile.html`:

```bash
wget -O myfile.html https://www.example.com/index.html
```

### Download to a different directory

To download a file to a directory on your instance other than the current one, specify the directory path with the `-P` option:

```bash
wget -P <directory_path> <URL_of_source_file>
```

**Example**

Download `index.html` from `https://www.example.com/` and save it to `/home/ubuntu/`:

```bash
wget -P /home/ubuntu/ https://www.example.com/index.html
```

### Download in background

To download a file in the background and continue running other commands, use the `-b` option:

```bash
wget -b <URL_of_source_file>
```

### Resume a download

To resume an interrupted download, use the `-c` option:

```bash
wget -c <URL_of_source_file>
```

### Limit download speed

To limit the download speed, use the `--limit-rate` option:

```bash
wget --limit-rate=<rate> <URL_of_source_file>
```

**Example**

```bash
wget --limit-rate=100k https://www.example.com/index.html
```
