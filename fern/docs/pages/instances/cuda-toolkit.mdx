## What is CUDA?

**CUDA** is a computing platform and programming architecture developed by [NVIDIA](https://developer.nvidia.com/about-cuda). It enables the use of NVIDIA GPUs for tasks beyond traditional graphics rendering, a practice known as **General-Purpose Computing on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU)**.

CUDA can significantly accelerate efforts such as AI training and scientific simulations by running many processes in parallel. 

## What is the CUDA Toolkit?

The **CUDA Toolkit** is an SDK provided by NVIDIA that contains tools, libraries, and resources to develop applications for CUDA-enabled GPUs. It includes these key components:

- [NVCC](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-compiler-driver-nvcc/index.html): the compiler driver that compiles CUDA code (usually written in C/C++) into an executable that can run on an NVIDIA GPU
- [cuda-gdb](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-gdb/index.html): a debugger for CUDA applications that integrates GPU and CPU debugging within the same environment
- Profiling and optimization tools: including the [CUDA Profiling Tools Interface (CUPTI)](https://developer.nvidia.com/cupti) and [NSight Compute](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-compute)
- [GPU-accelerated libraries](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpu-accelerated-libraries): libraries to speed up tasks such as math, quantum computing, data processing, graphics processing, deep learning

## Set environment variables

FluidStack's NVIDIA GPU instances are pre-installed with CUDA and the CUDA Toolkit. However, two environment variables must be configured before you can use the Toolkit globally on your FluidStack instance.

To configure these variables, [open an SSH session to your instance](/ssh/use-ssh-keys#connect-to-an-instance-with-an-ssh-key). Copy and paste the following three commands into the session:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

To confirm that the environment variables are set up correctly, enter the command:

```bash
nvcc --help
```

The expected output is the helpfile for the NVCC compiler.

## Find the current CUDA Toolkit version

[Set the CUDA Toolkit environment variables](#set-environment-variables) as described above if you have not already done so.

Then enter the following command in the same SSH session:

```bash
nvcc --version
```

If the CUDA Toolkit is installed and the environment variables are correctly configured, the output will show a release number, such as `12.6`. This number indicates the installed CUDA Toolkit version.

## The CUDA Samples repository

NVIDIA provides a repository of sample applications that demonstrates various CUDA features and best practices. This repository is available at: [https://github.com/nvidia/cuda-samples](https://github.com/nvidia/cuda-samples). To try it out, as well as to test that CUDA is properly installed on your instance, follow the steps below. 

<Info title="Important">
    Enter all commands shown below into an SSH session to your instance.
</Info>

<Steps>

    ### Clone the CUDA Samples repository

    Begin by cloning the repository to download all available samples to your instance. Run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nvidia/cuda-samples
```

    ### Move to the deviceQuery directory

    Move to the `deviceQuery` sample directory on the cloned repository:

```bash
cd cuda-samples/Samples/1_Utilities/deviceQuery
```

    ### Run `make`

    The `make` command compiles the CUDA code in the sample directory, generating an executable program that you can run. Enter the command:

```bash 
make
```

    The expected output is the creation of an executable named `deviceQuery`. 

    ### Run the deviceQuery application

    Run the compiled executable for the `deviceQuery` sample:

```bash
./deviceQuery
```

    If successful, you should see detailed output about each your instance's GPU(s), along with a final line that ends with `RESULT = PASS`. 

</Steps>

For any other samples in the CUDA Samples repository that you want to use, follow the same procedure. Move to the directory of the sample, run `make`, then run the compiled executable.

## How to update the CUDA Toolkit to the latest version

<Warning title="Warning">
    Updating drivers can sometimes produce unexpected results. Back up any important data on your instance before proceeding!
</Warning>

<Steps>

    ### Find the currently installed version number

    Follow the [instructions to find the current version installed on your instance](#find-the-current-cuda-toolkit-version).

    ### Find the latest CUDA Toolkit version number

    Go to [NVIDIA's update page](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=Ubuntu) and confirm that the version number is higher than the version that's currently installed on your instance.

    ### Select distribution version and installer type

    On NVIDIA's update page, select the distribution (operating system) version for your instance. For **Installer Type**, choose the **deb (network)** option.

    <Tip title="Tip">
        Not sure what distribution version your instance is running? To find out, enter the command `lsb_release -a` on your instance.
    </Tip>

    ### Run the installer commands

    On NVIDIA's update page, copy the commands under the **CUDA Toolkit Installer** instructions. Paste them into the SSH session to your instance.

    ### Upgrade packages

    Once the final command you copied has finished running, enter the following command to your instance:

```bash
sudo apt upgrade
```

    When prompted if you want to continue, press `Enter` to accept the default value of `Y`.

    If during the upgrade you are presented with a dialog titled "Pending kernel upgrade," press `Enter`. If this is followed by a dialog titled "Daemons using outdated libraries," again press `Enter`.

    Once the upgrade has finished, run the following command to confirm that your CUDA Toolkit version has been updated to the latest version:

```bash
nvcc --version
```

    ### Update the NVIDIA driver

    Next, run the following command to update the NVIDIA driver:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-open
```

    You might see the same "Pendel kernel upgrade" and "Daemons using outdated libraries" dialogs during this step. Press `Enter` on both dialogs. 

    ### Reboot
    
    To complete the NVIDIA driver update, reboot the instance:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

    Rebooting your instance closes your current SSH session, so you'll need to reconnect after the reboot. If you try to reconnect too soon, you might receive a "Connection refused" error. Wait for the instance to finish starting up and try again.

    <Tip title="Tip">
        If your instance fails to restart or SSH fails to reconnect after waiting for more than five minutes, try [stopping and starting the instance](/instances/manage/stop-and-start-instances).
    </Tip>

    ### Confirm the driver version

    Once you have logged back into your instance, run the following command:

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

    The CUDA version shown at the top of the output from this command should match the version of the CUDA Toolkit that you installed. 

    ### (Optional) Test devices with the CUDA Samples repository

    While this step is optional, it can help verify that the update was successful.

    Follow the steps under [The CUDA Samples repository](#the-cuda-samples-repository) to confirm that CUDA is functioning on all your instance's GPUs.
