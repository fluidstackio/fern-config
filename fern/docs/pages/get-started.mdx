subtitle: Create and access your first GPU instance
---

## Overview

This tutorial leads you through the following steps:

1. [Create a GPU instance.](#create-a-gpu-instance)
2. [Access your instance](#access-your-instance) using the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol and your SSH key.
3. (Optional): [Delete your instance](#optional-delete-your-instance).

## Prerequisites

 - An SSH key added to your FluidStack account. See: [Create an SSH key](/ssh/use-ssh-keys#create-an-ssh-key).
 - <Markdown src="../snippets/api-key.mdx" />

## Steps

<Steps>
### Create a GPU instance

When creating a GPU instance, you must specify one or more SSH keys. You can use the same SSH key for multiple instances. However, if more than one person intends to have access to an instance, use a different SSH key for each person.

{/* <AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use the FluidStack Dashboard">
    1. Open the [GPU Instances page on the FluidStack Dashboard](https://dashboard.fluidstack.io/dashboard/instances).
    2. Select **Deploy GPUs** from the upper-right corner.
    3. In the dialog that appears, select the instance's GPU type, then click **Configure**.
    4. Set the **Instance Name** and select an **OS Image** from the dropdown.
    5. Choose one or more SSH keys to associate with the instance, then click **Confirm**.

    You should now see the newly created instance in the GPU Instances page. Initially, its status is **pending**. The status updates to **running** once the instance is created and available. 
    
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use the FluidStack API"> */}
    The following values are required to create an instance:

    - the `name` of the instance
    - the`gpu_type` (See the `gpu_model` field from [Instance Configurations](/configurations-and-operating-systems/configurations).)
    - the `ssh_key_name`
    
    These values are optional:
    - `gpu_count` (Default: `1`)
    - `operating_system_label` (See the `label` field from [Operating Systems](/configurations-and-operating-systems/operating-systems). Default: `"ubuntu_20_04_lts"`)

    If you prefer, you can use a different [instance configuration](/configurations-and-operating-systems/configurations) and/or [operating system](/configurations-and-operating-systems/operating-systems). 

    To create an instance, call the API using the cURL command below. Replace `<api_key>` with your API key, and `<ssh_key_name>` with your SSH key's name:

    <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /instances" />

    If you have multiple SSH keys you'd like to associate with this instance, provide a comma-separated list in the cURL command:

    ```bash Multiple SSH keys example {2-4}
        "ssh_keys": [
          "my_key1",
          "my_key2",
          "my_key3"
        ]
    ```

    If your request succeeds, the endpoint responds with the created instance's details, including its `id`, `name`, `gpu_type`, and `operating_system_label`:

    <EndpointResponseSnippet endpoint="POST /instances" />

    Take note of the `id` of your instance. 

    Request the instance's status using the [`GET /instances`](/api-reference/instances/list) endpoint:

    <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /instances" />

    Initially, the instance's `status` will be `pending`. Once the instance is created and available, its `status` updates to `running` and it is assigned an IP address.

    Example:
    <EndpointResponseSnippet endpoint="GET /instances" />

    This endpoint returns all the instances on your account. Locate the instance with the `id` of your newly created instance. Take note of your instance's values for `username` and `ip_address` for the next step.

  {/* </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup> */}

### Access your instance 

Once the instance's status is `running`, you can connect to it using SSH. Use the private key that corresponds to the public key you used when creating the SSH key for this instance, and the `username` and `ip_address` values you noted in the previous step. 

<Markdown src="../snippets/connect-with-ssh.mdx" />

<Note>The first time you connect to your instance, you will see a message that says "The authenticity of host `x.x.x.x` can't be established ... Are you sure you want to continue connecting". This is normal for the first connection. Type `yes` and press `Enter`.</Note>

To close your connection and log out from the instance, type `exit` into your SSH session's command prompt and press `Enter`.

### (Optional): Delete your instance

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use the FluidStack Dashboard">
    <Markdown src="../snippets/open-dashboard.mdx" />
    <Markdown src="../snippets/delete-instance-dashboard.mdx" />
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use the FluidStack API">
    To delete your instance, close your SSH connection, then call the API using the cURL command below. Replace the text `instance_id` with the `id` value you received in the previous step when you created the endpoint, and use your API key.

    <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="DELETE /instances/:instance_id" />

    Example:

```bash title="Example request"
  curl -X DELETE https://platform.fluidstack.io/instances/i-d02e976e-29e4-4857-8787-2ebe17fa4972 \
  -H "api-key: api_key_j8FaG34rGUFDig1111qerdP1f5MfEeW9AI"
```
    To confirm that your instance was deleted, call the [`GET /instances`](/api-reference/instances/list) endpoint again as you did at the end of Step 1.

Congratulations! You have successfully created an instance, accessed it using SSH, and (optionally) deleted the instance.
