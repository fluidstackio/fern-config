---

## Overview

On this page, you will learn to do the following:
1. How to create a public/private key pair
2. How to create an instance
3. How to access your instance using the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol

## Prerequisites

 - Access to the [FluidStack Dashboard](https://dashboard.fluidstack.io)
 - <Markdown src="../snippets/api-key.mdx" />

 <Tip>Find out more about using API keys on the [Authentication](/authentication) page.</Tip>

## Steps

<Steps>
### Create a public/private key pair

<Markdown src="../snippets/public-key-formats.mdx" />

You can skip this step if you already have a public/private key pair that uses a supported format from the list above.

FluidStack grants you command-line access to your instances via [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell), using [public-key cryptography](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/public-key-authentication) instead of a login password for greater security. This means that you must locally generate a public/private key pair, then store your public key on your instances. You can then use your private key to access the instances.

You can generate a public/private key pair with a command-line tool called **ssh-keygen**. This tool comes pre-installed on most operating systems.

<Tip>If you are unable to use **ssh-keygen**, a popular alternative is [PuttyGen](https://www.puttygen.com/). Refer to the instructions on PuttyGen's website to generate a key pair with that tool.</Tip>

Below are tabs containing instructions for creating a key pair with either RSA format, or ECDSA with NIST curves format. Complete the instructions in one of the tabs only.

<Frame>
<Tabs>

  <Tab title="RSA">
    Enter the following command in your CLI shell:
```bash Use ssh-keygen for RSA
ssh-keygen
```
    If prompted to enter a filename, press `Enter` to save the key to the default location. When prompted to enter a passphrase, you can optionally do so to increase security.

    Enter the following command to confirm that your keypair was created:
```bash 
ls ~/.ssh
```
    In the output, you should see `id_rsa` (the file that contains your private key) and `id_rsa.pub` (the file that contains your public key).
    
    To view your public key, enter the command below:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
    Copy the output; this is your public key.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="ECDSA with NIST curves">
    Enter the following command in your CLI shell:
```bash Use ssh-keygen for ECDSA with NIST curves
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 256 -f ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_256
```
    If prompted to enter a filename, press `Enter` to save the key to the default location. When prompted to enter a passphrase, you can optionally do so to increase security.

    Enter the following command to confirm that your keypair was created:
```bash 
ls ~/.ssh
```
    In the output, you should see `id_ecdsa_256` (the file that contains your private key) and `id_ecdsa_256.pub` (the file that contains your public key).
    
    To view your public key, enter the command below:

```bash 
cat ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_256.pub
```
    Copy the output; this is your public key.

  </Tab>

</Tabs>
</Frame>

<Warning>
  With any public/private key pair that you generate, your public key can be shared freely. Your private key should be just thatâ€”private! Do not share it with others, or in public repositories such as in GitHub. 
</Warning>

### Create a SSH key on your FluidStack account

Once you have generated a key pair locally, use its public key to create an SSH key on your FluidStack account. In this context, _creating an SSH key_ means _storing a copy of your public key on your FluidStack account_. The stored SSH key is identical to your public key.

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Use the FluidStack Dashboard">
    1. Open the [SSH Keys page on the FluidStack Dashboard](https://dashboard.fluidstack.io/dashboard/ssh-keys).
    2. Select **Add SSH key** from the top right corner.
    3. In the popup form's **Name** field, input a unique name for this SSH key. 
    4. Paste your public key in the field labeled **Public SSH key**. Click **Confirm**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use the FluidStack API">
    Create an SSH key by using the [`POST /ssh_keys`](/api-reference/ssh-keys/create) endpoint. You can call this endpoint programmatically, or by using a command-line tool such as [cURL](https://curl.se/):

    <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /ssh_keys" />

    <Tip>Make sure to replace the `<api-key>` value with your own API key.</Tip>

    If your POST request is successful, the endpoint responds with a JSON object that echoes the `name` and `public_key` that you sent:

    ```json title="Response example"
    {
        "name": "mykey",
        "public_key": "<your_public_key>"
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
</AccordionGroup>

### Create an instance

When creating an instance, you must specify one or more SSH keys. You can use the same SSH key for multiple instances. However, if more than one person intends to have access to an instance, use a different SSH key for each person.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use the FluidStack Dashboard">
    1. Open the [GPU Instances page on the FluidStack Dashboard](https://dashboard.fluidstack.io/dashboard/instances).
    2. Select **Deploy GPUs** from the top right corner.
    3. In the popup form, select the instance's GPU type, then click **Configure**.
    4. Set the **Instance Name** and select an **OS Image** from the dropdown.
    5. Choose one or more SSH keys to associate with the instance, then click **Confirm**.

    You should now see the newly created instance in the GPU Instances page. Initially, its status is **pending**. The status updates to **running** once the instance is created and available. 
    
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use the FluidStack API">
    The following values are required to create an instance:

    - the `name` of the instance
    - the`gpu_type` (See the `gpu_model` field from [Configurations](/api-reference/configurations/list).)
    - the `ssh_key_name`
    
    These values are optional:
    - `gpu_count` (Default: `1`)
    - `operating_system_label` (See the `label` field from [Operating Systems](/api-reference/templates/list). Default: `"ubuntu_20_04_lts"`)

    If you prefer, you can use a different [configuration](/api-reference/configurations/list) and/or [operating system](/api-reference/templates/list). 

    Call the endpoint below to create a new instance. Replace `<api_key>` with your API key, and `<ssh_key_name>` with your SSH key's name:

    <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /instances" />

    If you have multiple SSH keys you wish to associate with this instance, use a comma-separated list:

    ```bash Multiple SSH keys example {2-4}
        "ssh_keys": [
          "my_key1",
          "my_key2",
          "my_key3"
        ]
    ```

    If your request is sent successfully, the endpoint responds with the created instance's details, including its `id`, `name`, `gpu_type`, and `operating_system_label`:

    <EndpointResponseSnippet endpoint="POST /instances" />

    Check the instance's status using the `GET /instances` endpoint:

    <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /instances" />

    Initially, the instance's `status` will be `pending`. Once the instance is created and available, its `status` updates to `running` and an IP address is assigned.

    Example:
    <EndpointResponseSnippet endpoint="GET /instances" />

    This endpoint returns all the instances on your account. Locate the instance with the `id` of your newly created instance. Take note of your instance's values for `username` and `ip_address` for the next step.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Access your instance 

Once the instance's status is `running`, you can connect to it using SSH. Use the private key that corresponds to the public key you used when creating the SSH key for this instance, and the `username` and `ip_address` values you noted in the previous step. 

```bash title="bash"
ssh -i <your_private_key> <username>@<ip_address>
```

<Note>The first time you connect to your instance, you will see a message that says "The authenticity of host `x.x.x.x` can't be established ... Are you sure you want to continue connecting". This is normal for the first connection. Type `yes` and press `Enter`.</Note>
