## View instances

From the left sidebar of the Dashboard, select [GPU Instances](https://dashboard.fluidstack.io/dashboard/instances) to display all instances on your account.

For each instance, the name, configuration, IP address, username for SSH login, SSH key for remote access, SSH port, and instance status are displayed.

## Add an instance

1. From the left side of the Dashboard, select [GPU Instances](https://dashboard.fluidstack.io/dashboard/instances).
2. Click the **Deploy GPUs** button in the upper-right corner. A dialog will appear.
3. Select your desired Instance Type, then click **Configure**.
4. Set the **GPU Count**, a custom **Instance Name**, the **OS Image**, and the **SSH Key** for remote access to the instance.
5. Click **Confirm**.

You should then see the newly created instance in the GPU Instances page. Initially, its status will be **pending**. The status will update to **running** once the instance is created and available.
