### Get the list of available operating systems

For the most up-to-date list, call the [`GET /list_available_os_templates`](/api-reference/templates/list) endpoint.

Example request using cURL:
<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /list_available_os_templates" />

The endpoint returns a list of operating systems, as shown in this example response:
<EndpointResponseSnippet 
  endpoint="GET /list_available_os_templates"
/>

Whenever you create an instance, you can optionally include a value for `"operating_system_label"`. To find the available options, see the values for `"label"` returned by this endpoint.

<Note>If you do not provide an `"operating_system_label"` value when creating an instance, `"ubuntu_20_04_lts"` is used as the default.</Note>
